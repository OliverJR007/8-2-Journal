Sprint Review and Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with actively listening to stakeholders and asking clarifying questions to fully understand their goals, frustrations, and desired outcomes. Translating these needs into clear user stories helps bridge the gap between technical tasks and real-world use. A good user story frames functionality from the user's perspective (e.g., "As a traveler, I want to see top destinations with pictures so I can choose where to go next"), which ensures that development efforts stay user-focused and aligned with the project’s purpose.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development as an iterative, feedback-driven process. Rather than building everything at once, I break the work into smaller, manageable features and prioritize what delivers the most value early on. I find Agile methodologies—especially Scrum—helpful in this approach. Processes like sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives create a rhythm of continual improvement. In future work, I hope to continue using these Agile practices to maintain flexibility, foster collaboration, and respond quickly to change.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means more than writing clean code. It involves clear communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to support others. Good team members are dependable, contribute actively to discussions, share knowledge, and remain open to feedback. They prioritize the team’s success over individual credit and contribute to a positive, problem-solving culture. Collaboration is key—software development is rarely a solo effort.
